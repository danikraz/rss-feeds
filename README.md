# rss feeds

A node.js app for fetching the latest news from different RSS feeds.

## Requirements

Node (I've used version 15)

## Build and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Navigate to http://localhost:5000/latest to see the 10 latest news items

Note that if you have something running on port 5000 you have to change it, you can easily change the port in index.ts
